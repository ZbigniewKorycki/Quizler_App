<h1>Quizzler App</h1>

Quizzler is a simple Python application that allows users to participate in a quiz game. It retrieves quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database and presents them to the user through a graphical user interface. Users can answer the questions by clicking on either a "True" or "False" button, and the application provides immediate feedback on the correctness of the response.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 34.
